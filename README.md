# **Address Book**


 Creating a web application that will be an address book. The tech stack will consist of Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, EJS, and Bootstrap and will be hosted on Render. The following is the features I want to have in the app:
 
The Home page will have a header with links to other pages of the web app. The navigation links will be: Home, Contacts, and Categories. There will be authentication and authorization so there will be a Login and Logout links as well. 

There will be pictures/graphic and a footer as well with my social media links and copyright.

The Contacts page will be able to scroll down to see all contacts but will have filtering capabilities using a search bar in a sidebar to filter on any term and also able to filter on a Categories dropdown.
